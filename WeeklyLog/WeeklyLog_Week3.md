### 3 - Challenges Encountered (1 mark)

- Challenge 1: Designing Databases
    - Took a while to consider how to save data, based on the use case and expected flow of data

Progress was slow for the week. Spent quite a bit of time setting up the database.
Priority for next week would be to start on the UI and implementing the web application code
