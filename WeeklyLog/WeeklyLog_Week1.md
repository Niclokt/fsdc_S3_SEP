### 3 - Challenges Encountered (1 mark)

> _(Mention any difficulties or issues faced and how they were addressed)_

- Challenge 1: Settling on 1 idea and the scope to be implemented.
    - I have many features and libraries I wanted to try out (e.g. three.js , telegram bot integration) But given the limited amount of time, I decided to build on top of what I was already familiar with and implement features that were feasible to acheive within the current timeline.
- Challenge 2: Figuring out the appropriate tech stack to use.
    - I knew I wanted to host my webapp serverlessly on Vercel, but wasn't sure what would be the appropriate tech stack / database to use. After some research, I chose Supabase over MS SQL primarily because serverless environments like Vercel are stateless and ephemeral. Since my application instances spin up and down dynamically to handle requests, traditional databases like MS SQL would struggle with connection — the new serverless function attempting to open a heavy, persistent connection, something that the database cannot handle at scale.

### 4 - Reflections (1 mark)

> _(Did you receive any feedback from your teammates, and how did you address or resolve it? Did you manage to complete the tasks you intended to finish this week? What will be your top priority for next week?)_

```
I managed to complete the tasks I set out for myself this week.
My priority next week would be to:
- (1) Complete the low resolution wireframe and
- (2) Set up the environment for my web app
```
